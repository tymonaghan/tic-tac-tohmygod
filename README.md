TIC-TACTICS-TOE
======
A new version of Tic Tac Toe.

# Rules
- Two players compete in rounds of Tic Tac Toe
- Each victory earns a meta-token for the victorious player
- Players may play meta-tokens, following the same rules as Tic Tac Toe, on the meta-game board
- Play on the meta-game board is turn-based, however players may play any number of tokens up to the amount they have available, or none at all. For example, a player could bank three meta-tokens over three victories in the standard game round, and then play all three meta-tokens simultaneously on a later turn.
