*9/13:* This is coming along nicely. The main menu works well, the player selection screen is making good progress, the game board draws properly and players can place their X/O tokens on the board. Still need to make the player name input work (that has been a really tricky part for me), add the "coin toss" to determine who goes first, and add end-game logic (detect and respond when a player has won or when the game is a draw).

*9/7:* The version-zero-point-one branch was my wishful thinking that I could recover some of the work I failed to save the other night, but there isn't much to it, so I won't be using it. But it's a good refresher on how branches work, I've never really needed to use them before.
